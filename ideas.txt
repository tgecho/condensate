dev helpers
	a function that can recieve changes and warns on any non whitelisted object types added to atom
	record changes
		show a list of the transactions and the resulting states
		allow viewing previous state trees
		allow setting the atom back to a previous state
			(how to handle pending transactions?)
		record a stack trace using an unthrown `new Error()`
			there may be performance implications for running this outside of dev
	allow modifying state of application through dev panel
		change strings/numbers (easy)
		add/remove list/map items (less easy)
		drag/copy/paste values around the tree (hard)


issues
	accidentally passed a string to .cursor() and just got undefined. this should either be handled as a one key path or raise an error

	consider adding get/getIn functions to atom/cursor
		these could return the values or cursors
